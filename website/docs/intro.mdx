# UAPK Gateway

**The agent firewall + black box recorder for high‑stakes AI.**

Deploy autonomous AI agents with **hard guardrails**, **human approvals**, and **tamper‑evident audit logs** — on **one VM**, self‑hosted.

[Start Pilot Program](business/pilot) | [Self-Host (Open Source)](quickstart) | [View on GitHub](https://github.com/UAPK/gateway)

> Agents don't "do" things directly. They **propose actions**.
> UAPK Gateway enforces **policy, permissions, budgets, risk hooks**, and produces **evidence‑grade interaction records** for auditors, regulators, and courts.

---

## Why this exists

Agentic AI is moving from "chat" to "action":

- Sending emails and messages
- Writing into CRMs and case systems
- Onboarding customers (KYC)
- Underwriting and claims triage
- Proposing trades / executing workflows

The moment agents touch **money, legal outcomes, privileged systems, or regulated data**, organizations hit the same wall:

### "Who authorized this?"
Attribution and accountability for agent decisions

### "Can we stop it at runtime?"
Real-time intervention and kill switches

### "Can we prove what happened?"
Evidence-grade audit trails for legal proceedings

### "How do we deploy safely?"
Compliance without blocking innovation

**UAPK Gateway is a control plane for agent actions** — designed for **legal, finance, and compliance** environments.

---

## The Solution

UAPK Gateway is a **single deployable service** (FastAPI + Postgres) that sits between agents and the outside world.

```mermaid

  A[Agent / Tool-Using Workflow] -->|Action Request| G[UAPK Gateway]
  G -->|ALLOW| T[Tool Connector: Webhook/HTTP/Custom]
  G -->|DENY| A
  G -->|ESCALATE| H[Human Approver UI/API]
  H -->|Approve/Deny| G
  G --> L[(Tamper-Evident Interaction Log)]
  G --> M[(Manifests + Policies + Keys)]
  G --> R[Risk Hook QIRE-lite / external]
```

**Key design principle:** the gateway is the **non-bypassable enforcement point**. In production, tools run with credentials controlled by the gateway — not by the agent.

---

## What You Get

### Policy Enforcement
ALLOW / DENY / ESCALATE decisions based on manifests, budgets, and risk hooks

### Capability Tokens
Scoped delegation with time limits, action allowlists, and cryptographic signatures

### Budgets & Rate Caps
Per-day, per-entity limits to prevent runaway costs and abuse

### Human Approvals
Escalate high-risk actions to operators via web UI or API

### Tamper-Evident Logs
Hash-chained, signed interaction records with verification scripts

### Compliance Exports
Audit bundles for regulators, auditors, and legal proceedings

### Connector Framework
Webhooks, HTTP, and custom tools with strict allowlists

### Production-Ready
Docker Compose deployment on one VM, self-hosted, no vendor lock-in

---

## Who It's For

### Teams shipping "agentic" workflows

- **Law firms and litigation boutiques** (IP enforcement, claims, settlements)
- **Banks, fintechs, and insurers** (KYC/onboarding, underwriting, internal copilots)
- **Compliance and risk teams** trying to approve agent deployments
- **AI product teams** who need a **governance story** to close enterprise deals

### If you're in any of these situations, you're the target

> "Our agent can do X, but compliance won't sign off."

> "We need approvals for certain actions."

> "We need audit trails that survive scrutiny."

> "We want to deploy agents, but safely and repeatably."

## Why UAPK Won't Be Obsolete

UAPK Gateway is **model‑agnostic** and **vendor‑agnostic**:

- It governs **actions** at the boundary to real systems
- It integrates with your existing IAM, secrets, logging, and approvals
- It produces **organization‑owned evidence** (not vendor-retention logs)

Model vendors can improve tracing and tool primitives — but regulated orgs still need:

- **Non-bypassable enforcement** at your boundary
- **Consistent cross-model governance** standards
- **Audit and retention** under your own policies

See [Future-Proof Architecture](concepts/future-proof.md) for details.

## The "47ers" Library

Pre-built templates ready to deploy as micro-services:

- **Legal:** Settlement gate, takedown gate
- **Compliance:** KYC onboarding gate, vendor due diligence gate
- **Finance:** Trading execution gate
- **General:** Outbound email guard

See the [47ers Library](47ers) for all templates.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**UAPK Manifest**](concepts/manifest) | JSON document defining an agent's identity, capabilities, and policies |
| [**Capability Token**](concepts/capabilities) | Signed tokens that delegate scoped authority with limits |
| [**Policy Decision**](concepts/decisions) | ALLOW, DENY, or ESCALATE based on policy evaluation |
| [**Approval Workflow**](concepts/approvals) | Human review process for escalated actions |
| [**Interaction Record**](concepts/logs) | Tamper-evident audit log with hash chaining + signatures |

---

## Architecture

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | Python 3.12 + FastAPI |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| UI | Jinja2 + HTMX (server-rendered) |
| Auth | JWT for humans, API keys for machines |
| Deployment | Docker Compose (dev & production) |
| Signatures | Ed25519 |

See [Architecture Overview](architecture/overview.md) for details.
