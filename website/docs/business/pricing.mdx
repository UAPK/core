## Pricing Philosophy

We believe in **transparent, value-based pricing**:

1. **Open-source core** - No vendor lock-in, no hidden costs
2. **Productized pilots** - Fixed-fee, fast time-to-value, no hourly billing
3. **Enterprise support** - Recurring revenue for ongoing value, not upfront licenses

**Why this works:**
- **For you:** Predictable costs, clear ROI, fast procurement
- **For us:** Sustainable business model, aligned incentives, customer success

## FAQ

**Q: Is the open-source version feature-complete?**

Yes. The Apache-2.0 version includes all core features: policy enforcement, capability tokens, approvals, tamper-evident logs, operator UI, and the 47ers library. Commercial offerings provide expertise and support, not locked features.

**Q: What's included in the pilot pricing?**

Fixed-fee pilot pricing includes everything listed in the "Agent Governance Pilot" section above. No hidden costs. Additional agents or workflows beyond the initial scope may require a change order.

**Q: Can we self-host after a pilot?**

Yes. Pilots deploy UAPK Gateway to **your** infrastructure. You own the deployment. After the pilot, you can self-manage (open-source) or transition to enterprise support.

**Q: What if the pilot doesn't meet objectives?**

We work closely to ensure success. If the pilot doesn't meet agreed objectives, there's no obligation to continue. Our goal is your success, not billable hours.

**Q: Do you offer hosted/SaaS deployment?**

Not currently. UAPK Gateway is designed for self-hosted deployment to ensure you own your data, evidence, and compliance posture. We can help with infrastructure setup as part of a pilot.

**Q: Can we start with open-source and upgrade later?**

Absolutely. Many customers start with self-hosted open-source to evaluate, then engage for a pilot when ready to deploy in production.

**Q: What payment methods do you accept?**

Pilots: ACH, wire transfer, or credit card (invoiced). Support contracts: Monthly or annual invoicing. We can accommodate most procurement processes.

**Q: Do you offer discounts for multiple pilots?**

Yes. Contact us for volume pricing if you have multiple workflows or business units that need governance.
