## 👨‍⚖️ Built by a Lawyer Who Codes

UAPK Gateway was built by a practicing lawyer and software developer who needed agent governance for their own law practice. When compliance asked "How do we prove what the agent did?", existing solutions fell short.

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ **Legal expertise** - Understands compliance from a lawyer's perspective
- ✅ **Technical execution** - Built the system personally
- ✅ **Real-world use** - Running in production at a law firm
- ✅ **Expert witness capability** - Can testify about system integrity if needed

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do you offer hosted/SaaS deployment?**
A: No, UAPK Gateway is self-hosted to ensure you own your data and compliance posture. We help with infrastructure setup as part of pilots.

**Q: Can we start with open-source and upgrade later?**
A: Absolutely! Many customers evaluate the open-source version first, then engage for a pilot when ready for production deployment.

**Q: What if the pilot doesn't meet objectives?**
A: We work closely to ensure success. If agreed objectives aren't met, there's no obligation to continue. Our goal is your success.

**Q: Why should we trust you over other vendors?**
A: UAPK Gateway was built by a practicing lawyer who understands compliance requirements from a legal perspective, not just a technical one. The system is open-source for full transparency, and the author can serve as an expert witness if needed.
