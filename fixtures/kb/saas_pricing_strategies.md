# SaaS Pricing Strategies

## Introduction
Effective pricing is critical for SaaS business success. This guide covers common pricing models and strategies.

## Common Pricing Models

### 1. Tiered Pricing
- **Starter**: Basic features, limited usage, $49/month
- **Professional**: Advanced features, higher limits, $199/month
- **Enterprise**: Custom features, unlimited usage, $999+/month

**Advantages**:
- Clear value differentiation
- Easy for customers to understand
- Upsell path built-in

### 2. Usage-Based Pricing
- Pay for what you use (e.g., per API call, per GB stored)
- Scales with customer growth
- Lower barrier to entry

**Best for**: Infrastructure services, developer tools, data platforms

### 3. Per-Seat Pricing
- Fixed price per user per month
- Predictable revenue
- Simple to calculate

**Best for**: Collaboration tools, project management, CRM

### 4. Feature-Based Pricing
- Different prices for different feature sets
- Allows precise value capture
- Can be complex to communicate

## VAT and Tax Considerations

### EU VAT Rules
- **B2B with valid VAT ID**: Reverse charge applies (0% VAT, customer pays)
- **B2C or B2B without VAT ID**: Apply VAT rate of customer's country
- **Non-EU**: No VAT charged

### Implementation
- Validate VAT IDs via VIES API
- Store customer jurisdiction and VAT information
- Generate compliant invoices with VAT breakdown
- Submit quarterly VAT reports

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
- Show higher-tier price first to anchor expectations
- Use "Most Popular" badges on mid-tier plans

### Simplicity
- Limit choices to 3-4 tiers
- Clear naming (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
- Transparent pricing (no hidden fees)

### Free Trials
- 14-30 day trials convert better than freemium for B2B
- Require credit card for higher-intent leads
- Proactive onboarding during trial

## Metrics to Track
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Lifetime Value (LTV)
- LTV:CAC ratio (should be > 3:1)
- Churn rate (monthly/annual)
- Expansion revenue
- Time to value

## Pricing Optimization
- A/B test pricing pages
- Survey customers on willingness to pay
- Monitor competitor pricing
- Annual pricing discounts (15-20% off)
- Grandfather existing customers on old pricing
